"""Fine-tune: line the CURSOR up with your IRON SIGHTS.

Two ways to use it. Shoot the ring at two distances and it separates an ANGULAR
sight offset (grows with range) from a PARALLAX one (constant) -- applying the
wrong kind is worse than none. Or skip the shooting: nudge with the arrows
until the cursor sits on your notch and press SAVE NOW, which keeps exactly the
preview you are looking at as a constant offset. Mixing is safe: a ring shot
only ever measures what is left AFTER your nudges.

Nudges go out as "aimcal!=" (applied, not written to flash); saving installs
and persists. LEAD +/- trades latency for overshoot on reversals."""
