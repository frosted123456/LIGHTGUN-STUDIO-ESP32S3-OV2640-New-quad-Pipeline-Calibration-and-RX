  1 buttons & pins (OpenFIRE app)   2 camera tuning   3 lens / FOV
  4 aim calibration                 5 fine tune       6 verify

Order matters: aim error scales with blob noise, so the calibration step stays
locked until step 2 reports a usable noise floor. Step 3 only matters when the
camera does not wear the stock 66-degree lens. F9 freezes the cursor while the
window is open; steps that need the gun release it and put it back."""
